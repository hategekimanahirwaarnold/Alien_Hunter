# Alien Hunter

## It's game time!

Yeah, you heard it right. Starting from now you are going to conquer the aliens around the galaxies.

You will be equiped with a `strong` gun which destroys the powerful aliens in a matter of seconds.
Hold on! For `bigger` aliens one bullet is not enough; you will be better off pull the trigger multiple times.
You may wonder where trigger is located. Right? Don't worry, I got your back. Just press your `f or F or enter` keys, or
`click` with your mouse.

`Notice:` The direction of your powerful bullets is the same as the direction of your mouse or where you will click
with your mouse. Also, note that you will enjoy it the most if you are playing with your computer.

Bear with me; it's game time! Just say `Yihhaaaaaaaaaa!` and brace for the aliens.

Enjoy,

Hirwa Arnold
